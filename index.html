    <h2>Hello, my name is Dalton Bumb</h2>
    <p>I am a junior computer science student at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I enjoy software enineering and have a passion for anything technology.</p>
    <p>Over the course of summer 2023, I was a software engineering intern at Berry global. During my time as an intern, I received valuable experience with full-stack development. I am currently seeking an internship for summer 2024.</p>
    <p>I have experience with Python, Java, C, React, Javascript, and Blazor among other technologies.</p>
    <!-- <p>I am Dalton Bumb, a dedicated junior computer science student committed to the pursuit of knowledge and excellence within the 
      realm of technology. My journey in computer science has been marked by a relentless pursuit of understanding and mastery in this 
      dynamic field. 
    </p>  
      <p>My fascination with computer science began during my formative years, and it has since evolved into a profound passion 
      for programming, problem-solving, and innovation. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in core computer science 
      principles, including algorithms, data structures, and software engineering practices. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Beyond the classroom, I have actively sought 
      opportunities to apply my skills in practical settings. Internships and personal projects have afforded me invaluable hands-on experience,
