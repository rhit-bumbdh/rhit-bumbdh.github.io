    <p>I am Dalton Bumb, a dedicated junior computer science student committed to the pursuit of knowledge and excellence within the 
      realm of technology. My journey in computer science has been marked by a relentless pursuit of understanding and mastery in this 
      dynamic field. 
    </p>  
      <p>My fascination with computer science began during my formative years, and it has since evolved into a profound passion 
      for programming, problem-solving, and innovation. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in core computer science 
      principles, including algorithms, data structures, and software engineering practices. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Beyond the classroom, I have actively sought 
      opportunities to apply my skills in practical settings. Internships and personal projects have afforded me invaluable hands-on experience, 
      allowing me to tackle real-world challenges and collaborate effectively within diverse teams.
      </p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, where you can explore a curated collection of my projects and gain insight into my journey as 
      a computer science student. I welcome opportunities for collaboration, 
      networking, and engaging in meaningful conversations about the future of technology.</p>
